# Feedback Form

## Description

My Feedback Form application allows the user to answer some typical feedback questions using different methods on each page. On the starting page, the user can select a number between 1 and 5 then click 'NEXT' to continue to the next page. The User must make a selection on the current page before they can continue to the next page. On the following page, the user will use a sliding scale to choose a number between 1 and 5 to answer the question. The next page will allow the user to make a choice between 1 and 5 using stars as an input. The last question page is for written comments that the user can use or not. The review page, allows to the user to see all of their inputs and has the ability to change any before submitting the feedback. Once the user feels comfortable to submit, they can click on 'SUBMIT' to send their feedback to the database. After submission, the user gets a confirmation of submission and is prompted whether or not they want to submit a new form. 

## Prerequisites

* Node.js
* Express
* PG
* React
* Redux
* axios
* Material-UI

## Installation

1. Create database named "prime_feedback"
2. The queries in the database.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. I recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries,
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an 'npm install'.
4. Use 'npm run server' in one terminal.
5. Use 'npm run client' in another terminal.
6. Open browser and visit localhost:3000 to use site.
